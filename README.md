## Quick Installation
```powershell
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justingray82/PSFive9CloudAPI/main/Install-PSFive9CloudAPI.ps1" | iex
Import-Module PSFive9CloudAPI -Force
```

## Usage

### ApiControl Authentication (OAuth2)

Connect using CustomerKey and SecretId. You'll be prompted to save credentials for future use:
```powershell
Connect-Five9Cloud -DomainId "12345" -AuthEndpoint "ApiControl" -CustomerKey "CustomerKey12345" -SecretId "SecretId67890"
```

### CloudAuth Authentication (Basic)

Connect using Username and Password. You'll be prompted to save credentials for future use:
```powershell
Connect-Five9Cloud -DomainId "12345" -AuthEndpoint "CloudAuth" -Username "user@domain.com" -Password "password"
```

### Using Saved Credentials

Use previously saved ApiControl credentials:
```powershell
Connect-Five9Cloud -DomainId "12345" -ExistingAuthorization $true -AuthEndpoint "ApiControl"
```

If both credential types are saved, you'll be prompted to choose:
```powershell
Connect-Five9Cloud -DomainId "12345" -ExistingAuthorization $true
```

### Regional Support

Specify a region other than US:
```powershell
Connect-Five9Cloud -DomainId "12345" -AuthEndpoint "ApiControl" -CustomerKey "YourKey" -SecretId "YourSecret" -Region "EU"
```

### Example Operations

After connecting, you can use various functions to manage your Five9 environment:
```powershell
# List all users
Get-Five9CloudListUsers

# Get a specific user
Get-Five9CloudRetrieveUser -UserUID "user-12345"

# List campaigns
Get-Five9CloudListCampaigns

# Start a campaign
Start-Five9CloudCampaign -CampaignId "campaign-67890"
```

## Requirements

## Credential Storage

Credentials are securely stored using PowerShell's encryption capabilities:
